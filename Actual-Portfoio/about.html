    <p>Jalani, duh. You know why you came here. It's beacuse you totally want to hire me and see all of the potential oozing out of both my orificies and the orifices of your computer/phone/tablet. </p>
    <p>Look, I know I'm awesome and I know you know I'm awesome. But so that you can really <strong>understand</strong> the depth of my awesomeness, you should have some knowledge about why I'm here in the first place.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Emory in 2017 and got a entry-level job as a corporate slave/trained monkey and left 3 months later. 'Twas the culmination of 4+ years of schooling thrown out the window in an effort to preserve my own sanity.</p>

    <p>After combing my brain for a few seconds in search of a purpose, I remembered that my desire to study computer science in high school was trumped by imaginary pressure from my parents to pursue what they had wanted for me. So, i reached out to people I knew on social media who knew how to code! Luckily, the great, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhismabakhai/" style="color:#E55B1C">Bhisma Bakhai</a>, reached back out to me.</p>
    <p>Among other common interests we found that we didn't want to go back to school to try and become the expert coders we are today. Together we found the coding bootcamp, DigitalCrafts, where I learned many of the techniques and approaches to coding that I possess today! </p>
    <p>Now, I strive to change and adapt my brain in pace with today's ever-chaning technologies and programming languages so that I can keep building projects that are almost as awesome as this portfolio.</p>
