    <p>Jalani, duh. You know why you came here. It's because you totally want to hire me and see all of the potential oozing out of both my orificies and the orifices of your computer/phone/tablet. </p>
    <p>Look, I know I'm awesome and I know you know I'm awesome. But so that you can really <strong>UNDERSTAND</strong> the depth of my awesomeness, you should have some knowledge about why I'm here in the first place.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Emory in 2017, got an entry-level job as a corporate slave/trained monkey, and left three months later. 'Twas the culmination of four-plus years of schooling thrown out the window in an effort to preserve my own sanity.</p>
    <!-- unfinished -->
    <p>After combing my brain for a few seconds in search of a purpose, I remembered that my desire to study computer science in high school was trumped by imaginary pressure from my parents to pursue what they had wanted for me. So, I reached out to people I knew on social media who knew how to code! Luckily, the great <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhismabakhai/" style="color:#E55B1C">Bhisma Bakhai</a> responded.</p>
    <p>Among other common interests, we found that neither of us wanted to go back to school in order to become the expert coders we are today. Together we looked for alternatives and found DigitalCrafts, a coding bootcamp. There I learned many of the techniques and approaches to coding that I possess today and met some of the kindest instructors and peers! </p>
    <p>Now, I strive to adapt my brain in pace with today's ever-changing technologies and programming languages so I can keep building projects that are almost as awesome as this portfolio.</p>

      <h2>TL ; DR</h2> 
         <li>Graduated from Emory in 2017</li>
         <li>Worked a non-tech gig immediately afterwards for 3 months</li>
        <li>Quickly became unfulfilled and made a career change</li>
        <li>Re-ignited an ever-present passion for technology</li>
        <li>Stuided at the DigitalCrafts coding Bootcamp to explore that passion</li>
        <li>My fire of passion has become perpetually stoked and I am ready to continue developing my skills as a developer with a reputable organization!</li>
